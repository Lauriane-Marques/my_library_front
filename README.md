# My Library - _front_

> You can find the back [here](https://github.com/Lauriane-Marques/my_library_back)
> > This project is deployed on Vercel, you can access it [here](https://my-library-seven-psi.vercel.app/) (still a WIP)

### What is it ?‚ùì

The goal of this website it to help you follow track of your readings. Once connected, you can add books to your lists, divided in "To read", "Reading" and "Finished". In the future you'll also be able to add/follow other users to connect with them and see what they're reading. 

### Who am I? üë©‚Äçüíª

I'm currently studying **Full-stack Development** and I'd like to have a concrete project to work on to practice what I've learned (_and am still learning_).   

### Why this project? üìö

I've always loved reading and I own a bit over a hundred books. How do I keep track of all of that ? Considering that I also read some books on my e-reader... _**A struggle.**_   
Some apps already exist for that _(e.g. [Gleeph](https://gleeph.com/), [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/), [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/))_ so you might see some similarities. However, this project will be completely written by me.

### What do I use? üíª

I'll be using the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) API to retrieve book data.   
The **front** will be using React.  
The **back** will be using Node.JS, Express, Prisma and a Neon database for the users data.

_This personnal project allows me to practice what I've learned on my coding journey, there might be errors and everything might not be top efficiency_
